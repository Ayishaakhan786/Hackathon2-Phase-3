## Prompt

Execute the implementation planning workflow using the plan template to generate design artifacts.

## Response snapshot

Completed implementation planning for the AI Agent, Runner & Stateless Chat Orchestration feature. Created all required documentation artifacts including plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and API contracts in the contracts/ directory. Verified compliance with project constitution and updated agent context with new technology information.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Full implementation plan created with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run yet (planning phase)
- 📁 Files: 5 new files created across documentation and contracts
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with task breakdown using sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase completed successfully, all constitutional requirements verified

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with task breakdown
