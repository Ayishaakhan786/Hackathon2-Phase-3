# Create Implementation Plan for Frontend Todo UI

## Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Frontend Main Page UI of a Todo application. The plan includes technical context, constitution check, project structure, and details for all phases of implementation.

## Original Prompt
/sp.plan Spec: Frontend Main Page UI — Todo Application

Plan Overview:
Implement the main page UI incrementally with strict control over scope.

Step 1: Audit Existing Main Page
- Review `app/page.tsx`
- Identify existing markup and structure
- Remove unnecessary placeholder content
- Do not delete files unless explicitly required

Step 2: Define Page Layout
- Create a centered container with max width
- Add page heading ("Todo App")
- Add subtitle or short description (optional)

Step 3: Add Task Input Section
- Text input for task title
- Primary action button ("Add Task")
- Proper spacing and alignment
- UI only (no submit logic)

Step 4: Implement Task List UI
- Render a static list of example tasks (hardcoded)
- Each task displayed as a row or card
- Include:
  - Checkbox or toggle icon
  - Task text
  - Delete icon/button

Step 5: Visual States
- Style completed tasks differently
  - Line-through text
  - Muted color
- Hover and focus states for buttons
- Accessible contrast ratios

Step 6: Responsiveness
- Stack elements vertically on mobile
- Maintain spacing and readability on larger screens

Step 7: Cleanup & Validation
- Remove unused imports
- Ensure `"use client"` is only where required
- Run `npm run dev`
- Confirm no console or build errors

Deliverables:
- Updated `app/page.tsx`
- Any small supporting components under `app/components/` if needed
- No changes outside frontend UI scope

Definition of Done:
- Main page UI matches Todo app requirements
- App runs successfully
- Code is clean, readable, and hackathon-ready

## Response
Completed the implementation plan with the following artifacts:

1. Updated implementation plan at `/specs/005-frontend-todo-ui/plan.md`
2. Research summary at `/specs/005-frontend-todo-ui/research.md`
3. Data model at `/specs/005-frontend-todo-ui/data-model.md`
4. Quickstart guide at `/specs/005-frontend-todo-ui/quickstart.md`
5. UI contract at `/specs/005-frontend-todo-ui/contracts/ui-contract.md`
6. Updated agent context in QWEN.md

The plan covers all required aspects of the frontend todo UI implementation, including technical context (TypeScript 5.0+, Next.js 16+, React 19+, Tailwind CSS), project structure, constitution check compliance, and detailed research on implementation approaches.
