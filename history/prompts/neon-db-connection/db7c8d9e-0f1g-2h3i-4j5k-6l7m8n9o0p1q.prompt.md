## Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for connecting the existing backend and frontend with a Neon PostgreSQL database. The plan includes technical context, constitution check, project structure, and details for all phases of implementation.

## Original Prompt
$ARGUMENTS

## Response
Completed the implementation plan with the following artifacts:

1. Updated implementation plan at `/specs/006-neon-db-connection/plan.md`
2. Research summary at `/specs/006-neon-db-connection/research.md`
3. Data model at `/specs/006-neon-db-connection/data-model.md`
4. Quickstart guide at `/specs/006-neon-db-connection/quickstart.md`
5. API contract at `/specs/006-neon-db-connection/contracts/health-check-api.md`
6. Updated agent context in QWEN.md

The plan covers all required aspects of the Neon database connection implementation, including technical context (Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL), project structure, constitution check compliance, and detailed research on implementation approaches.
